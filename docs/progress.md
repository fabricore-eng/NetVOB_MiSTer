# NetVOB_MiSTer — progress log (the loop's checkpoint "memory")

Durable, human-readable trail for the unattended `/loop` run
([`autonomy.md`](autonomy.md) §0). Git history is the *primary* checkpoint; this is the
at-a-glance state a fresh context (or a human) reads to resume **without re-deriving it**.

- **Single-writer:** only the orchestrator (main thread) appends here — never a parallel
  agent ([`autonomy.md`](autonomy.md) §5).
- **One dated line per cycle.** Format:
  `YYYY-MM-DD — <advanced> | blocked: <…> | building: <…>`
- Keep it terse; the commit it accompanies holds the detail.

- 2026-06-03 — Planning phase complete (PLAN.md + docs + autonomy/bootstrap layer, incl.
  the §0 `/loop` kickoff pattern). Loop not yet started. First cycle must: run
  `scripts/verify-session.sh`, then post the consolidated resource request per
  `session-bootstrap.md` (SSH to mister/Pi, `.env`, DVD dumps, Quartus, Plex/TMDB) before
  any build/HW work. blocked: nothing yet | building: nothing.
- 2026-06-03 (cycle 1) — **M1a de-risk CLEARED IN SIM**: vendored `mpeg2fpga` +
  `MiSTer_MPEG2` as pinned submodules (all 6 upstream SHAs git-confirmed — supersedes the
  page-parse caveat); stood up `core/sim/` Verilator harness that decodes `greyramp.mpg`
  to a correct interlaced RGB frame PNG, **reproduced byte-identical from a pristine
  checkout** (md5 80eef456…), with the 3 RTL-vs-Verilator fixes captured as an
  auto-applied re-appliable patch. Also landed (off-target, all tests pass): `service/`
  provider (Source ABC + catalog + protocol + streamer + DVDDumpSource PS nav-strip + Plex
  stub, 43 unittests), `arm/` PS-demux (PS→video ES, audio-aware, PTS, 5 C tests),
  `tools/` harness (480i/480p MPEG-2 PS clip gen + filmstrip). Preflight = LOCAL Mac,
  sim-only (toolchain green; all `.env` hosts empty). blocked: hardware/build-box/Pi/DVD
  dumps + Plex/TMDB creds — **consolidated resource request posted to user** (user offered
  SuperStation+Pi+build-box+dumps+both creds; headless Dell/Ubuntu proposed as build box +
  dump host — awaiting `.env` values). building: nothing (all increments verified+committed).
  next: decoder-sim breadth (real-motion I/P/B clip via `tools/` clips→ES; NTSC 480i
  modeline; numeric PSNR-vs-ffmpeg check) — all sim-only, no hardware needed.
