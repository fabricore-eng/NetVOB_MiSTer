# NetVOB_MiSTer — progress log (the loop's checkpoint "memory")

Durable, human-readable trail for the unattended `/loop` run
([`autonomy.md`](autonomy.md) §0). Git history is the *primary* checkpoint; this is the
at-a-glance state a fresh context (or a human) reads to resume **without re-deriving it**.

- **Single-writer:** only the orchestrator (main thread) appends here — never a parallel
  agent ([`autonomy.md`](autonomy.md) §5).
- **One dated line per cycle.** Format:
  `YYYY-MM-DD — <advanced> | blocked: <…> | building: <…>`
- Keep it terse; the commit it accompanies holds the detail.

- 2026-06-03 — Planning phase complete (PLAN.md + docs + autonomy/bootstrap layer, incl.
  the §0 `/loop` kickoff pattern). Loop not yet started. First cycle must: run
  `scripts/verify-session.sh`, then post the consolidated resource request per
  `session-bootstrap.md` (SSH to mister/Pi, `.env`, DVD dumps, Quartus, Plex/TMDB) before
  any build/HW work. blocked: nothing yet | building: nothing.
